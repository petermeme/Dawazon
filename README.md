The architecture used for the project is Model - View -Template architecture(MVT).

This is a variation of MVC architecture, primarily used in the Django framework. It consists of:

Model:  Manages data, logic, and rules of the application, it represents the data structure of the application.
View: In MVT, the View handles business logic and processes HTTP requests to return responses.
